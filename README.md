# custom-assembly-language
my custom assembly with weird syntax and very limited capabilities, soon to be rewritten in c so i can use memory in the assembly language
syntax examples:
FUNC(YES IN CAPS), number(in base 10),number(in base 10)
output in binary. 
check code to see available functions.
soon to be rewritten in c if i dont forget about this project
